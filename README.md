# Do-people-emigrate-out-of-their-country-if-the-country-has-a-lower-GDP
This project aims to explore the factors responsible for individuals migrating to another country. Data analysis was done by running a multiple linear regression model and integrating transformations and interaction terms with net migration as the response variable and GDP, death rate, infant mortality, and the region as explanatory variables.
